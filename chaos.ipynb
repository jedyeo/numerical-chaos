    "- In one instance researchers required the use of a $3500$th-order Taylor expansion method with $4180$-point precision to achieve a convergent numerical solution to the chaotic Lorenz equation over a large time horizon $([0, 10000])$.\n",

    "- It is clear that numerically accurate simulations of chaotic dynamical solutions are particularly difficult to develop. We are eager to explore recent advances in addressing this issue more deeply."
